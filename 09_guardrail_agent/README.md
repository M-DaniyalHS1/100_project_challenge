🚀 Guardrail Project
This project demonstrates the implementation of guardrail functionalities within the context of the OpenAI Agent SDK, leveraging the intuitive Chainlit UI for the conversational interface and powered by the Gemini Large Language Model.

📌 Project Description
This project serves as an example of how to integrate custom guardrails into an agent-based application. It utilizes:

OpenAI Agent SDK as the foundational framework.

Chainlit UI to provide a rich, interactive chat experience.

Gemini LLM for generating responses with natural language understanding.

🔒 The core focus is on showcasing how to define and enforce specific rules or constraints (guardrails) on the LLM’s output to ensure: ✔️ Safety ✔️ Relevance ✔️ Adherence to guidelines

✨ Features
✅ Guardrail Implementation – Define and apply custom rules to filter or modify LLM responses. ✅ Chainlit UI – Provides a user-friendly, web-based conversational interface. ✅ Gemini LLM Integration – Powerful AI model for understanding and generation. ✅ OpenAI Agent SDK – Built for agent orchestration and management. ✅ Interactive Conversations – Users can chat with the agent and observe guardrails in action.

⚡ Installation
Step 1: Clone the repository
sh
git clone https://github.com/M-DaniyalHS1/100_project_challenge.git
cd 100_project_challenge/09_guardrail_agent
Step 2: Create a virtual environment (recommended)
sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
Step 3: Install dependencies
sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
📌 Ensure you have a requirements.txt file listing essential libraries like openai-agent-sdk, chainlit, google-generativeai, etc. (If missing, generate it using pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing the libraries.)

Step 4: Set up API keys
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys:

sh
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
Replace "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" with your actual Gemini key. You might need OpenAI API keys too:

sh
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
🎮 Usage
Run the Chainlit application:
sh
chainlit run your_main_file.py -w
🛠️ Replace your_main_file.py with the name of your main application script. 🔄 The -w flag enables auto-reloading on file changes.

Open the UI:
💻 Once started, visit http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

Interact with the agent:
💬 Start typing in the chat interface and observe the guardrails in action!
