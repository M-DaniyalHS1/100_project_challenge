OpenAI Agent SDK Guardrail ProjectThis project demonstrates the implementation of guardrail functionalities within the context of the OpenAI Agent SDK, leveraging the intuitive Chainlit UI for the conversational interface and powered by the Gemini Large Language Model.Project DescriptionThis project serves as an example of how to integrate custom guardrails into an agent-based application. It utilizes the OpenAI Agent SDK as the foundational framework, Chainlit to provide a rich, interactive chat interface, and the Gemini LLM for generating responses. The core focus is on showcasing how to define and enforce specific rules or constraints (guardrails) on the LLM's output to ensure safety, relevance, and adherence to desired guidelines.FeaturesGuardrail Implementation: Demonstrates how to define and apply custom guardrails to filter or modify LLM responses.Chainlit UI: Provides a user-friendly, web-based conversational interface to interact with the agent.Gemini LLM Integration: Utilizes the Gemini model for natural language understanding and generation.OpenAI Agent SDK Base: Built upon the OpenAI Agent SDK for agent orchestration and management.Interactive Conversation: Allows users to chat with the agent and observe the guardrails in action.InstallationTo get this project up and running, follow these steps:Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/M-DaniyalHS1/100_project_challenge.git
cd 100_project_challenge/09_guardrail_agent
Note: I've corrected the clone command and directory change to standard Git/terminal syntax.Create a virtual environment (recommended):python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
(Make sure you have a requirements.txt file listing all necessary libraries like openai-agent-sdk, chainlit, google-generativeai, etc. If not, create one manually or generate it using pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing the libraries).Set up API Keys:You will need API keys for the Gemini LLM. Create a .env file in the root of your project and add your API key:GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
Replace "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" with your actual Gemini API key. You might also need OpenAI API keys if the Agent SDK requires it for core functionalities, in which case add OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" as well.UsageRun the Chainlit application:chainlit run your_main_file.py -w
Replace your_main_file.py with the name of your main Python file that contains the Chainlit application code. The -w flag enables auto-reloading on file changes.Open the UI:Once the command runs, Chainlit will provide a local URL (usually http://localhost:8000). Open this URL in your web browser.Interact with the agent:You can now start typing messages in the chat interface. Observe how the guardrails influence the agent's responses based on the rules you have implemented.Project Structure(This section is optional but helpful.
